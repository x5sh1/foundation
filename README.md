Some foundation algorithms

This repository stores code of foundtion algorithms.

All of implementations are JAVA.

Implemented algorithms:
1. quick sort

2. insert sort

3. merge sort

4. binary search. It includes base binary search, binary search in 2D array and find the closest element.

5. heap

6. a^b

7. check if a binary tree is complete.

8. remove char from string

9. remove duplicated spaces

10. replace sub-string by other string

11. reverse a string

12. reverse a sentence

13. A1B2 - > AB12 -> A1B2

14. check if a tree is BST

15. print all elements of BST in some range

16. determain a string has dupliacted char by bit

17. reverse all bits if a number
